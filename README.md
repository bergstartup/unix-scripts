Customizing unix scripts for making life easier
<br>
Few commands are coded to abstract repeated routines and a script to save todo.

<br>
#Capture
<br>
This command captures the set of scripts and save in a file, those scripts could be called via implement branch_name to get executed. Similar to defining a global shell function.
<br>
Initially this capture command was planned for capturing current state of system including current process, RAM storage etc. So that, that state could be restored after bootup.
