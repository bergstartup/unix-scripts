# Unix Scripts
Customized unix scripts for making life easier
<br>
Few commands are coded to abstract repeated routines and a script to save todo.

# Capture
  A command intially planned to snapshot the system state and restore after the system bootup. I have just implemented a easier version of it. This just capture set shell scripts and assign a environmental variable to it. That script could be implemneted just by calling its name.<br>
  Two parts of this script are, capture and implement. "Capture" records the shell script and provides custom variable to it. "Implement <variable_name>" implements the script.
